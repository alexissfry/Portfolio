                During my time at Cisco, my team was doing a large-scale

                engineers to post a ticket on our kanban board and automatically
                get added to the SBG GitHub organization, replacing an otherwise
                manual process.

            <p class="body-text">
              Early on in my internship, I set up meetings with engineers from
              other teams and all members of my own team to ask about their
              experience and frustrations with tool migrations. Through these
              conversations, I was able to identify user
              <strong>pain points</strong>.

                  Engineers on my team were spending time manually adding users
                  to SBG's GitHub organization, which would interrupt other,
                  more important work and especially become time consuming
                  during external company acquisitions.

                  have access needed for any work. The need for multiple actions
                  internally and externally could be simplified with automation.

            <h2>Design Decisions</h2>
            <p class="body-text">
              Before jumping into implementation, I met with my team to discuss
              the underlying design of the system. A very important decision was
              if the automation was going to be built with an API gateway or a
              Flask web app, so we weighed the most relevant pros and cons.
            </p>
            <div class="context-container">

              />
            </div>
            <p class="body-text space-bottom">
              Ultimately, we decided for the foundation of the automation
              platform to be a Flask web app due to its accessible, extensible
              nature as it will change to automate more tasks, my prior
              experience using this framework, and ability to scale.

            <p class="body-text space-bottom">
              This diagram shows the flow of information through my application.
              The workflow starts by a user posting a ticket to our Jira board,
              specifying a task ‚Äúcode‚Äù in the title, and giving the Cisco ID of
              the user that needed to be added in the description. Upon the
              creation of a ticket, a webhook would send the ticket data in the
              form of a JSON to my application, which would then need to be
              parsed to trigger calls to certain endpoints and, in turn,
              interface with the Jira, GitHib, and Cisco MyID REST APIs. A
              result wouldis then be returned back to the user on the original
              Jira ticket, stating whether they were successfully onboarded onto
              GitHub or not.

            <h2>Implementation: Balancing UX & Dev Time</h2>
            <p class="body-text">
              One technical takeaway from this project was a design decision I
              needed to make when figuring out how to parse data. During
              testing, I noticed that if a user applied any styling, such as a
              hyperlink or italics, to within the body of the ticket request,
              the JSON shape would change and my code would be unable to find
              the user ID in the expected layer of the description. I had two
              options: to tell the user not to apply styling or links to their
              ticket text or to rebuild and test a new parsing class. I realized
              that adding this specification to the automation platform‚Äôs user
              docs could be easily missed and cause lots of frustration if a
              user‚Äôs request fails. Thus, I opted to put the user first and
              redevelop the parsing component of the application.

              Throughout the development process, I wrote units in pytest to
              ensure that the endpoints of each function were working as
              expected leveraging mocked ticket data. Thorough testing was
              especially important for this project as it was necessary to parse
              commands from Jira tickets which might not properly follow the
              code schema I created. In both success cases and a variety of
              error cases, such as incorrectly formatted tickets and system
              errors, it was necessary to send different communications back to
              the user.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text space-bottom">
              I also used Postman to intercept and send test API requests to my
              application to make sure that the success and error responses were
              returning as expected. This was especially useful as the
              automation platform interacted with multiple APIs, and I could
              ensure that the platform was sending the proper requests to such
              interfaces.

            <h2>Documentation & Presentation</h2>
            <p class="body-text">
              Externally for users of the automation platform, I created
              documentation that specifies how to format and submit a ticket to
              my team‚Äôs kanban board that would kick off the automation
              workflow. Internally for my team, I produced a design doc that
              contained a high level overview of my project, technical
              implementation details, and next steps to continue scaling it up
              to an automation platform that could perform the creation of new
              repositories, Jira projects, and AD/Okta groups.

            <h1 class="space-bottom">Takeaways</h1>
            <p class="body-text">
              I grew a ton as an engineer and gained perspective on how much it
              really takes companies to carry out the development of software
              that is used by millions across the world.
            </p>
            <h4>‚û°Ô∏è Take initiative to communicate</h4>
            <p class="body-text">
              Since I was working on a distributed, mostly remote team,
              communication was key to keeping my mentor and manager updated on
              my progress. Further, making sure to reach out to point people
              when I could not unblock myself was essential to staying on
              timeline and being able to get to the deployment stage.
            </p>
            <h4>‚û°Ô∏è Always stay close to the user as an engineer</h4>
            <p class="body-text">
              If people don‚Äôt use your product, it will not survive. It is easy
              as an engineer to feel very isolated from the user when getting in
              the weeds of technical implementation. However, especially as a
              full-stack engineer, the user‚Äôs experience should always be
              prioritized. I believe this is one essential step to build
              products people love.
