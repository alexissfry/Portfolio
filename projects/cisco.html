                product, infrastructure, and data teams within Cisco Secure to
                provide and support common engineering tools.

                During my time at Cisco, my team was doing a large-scale

                an end-to-end automation platform that would allow internal
                engineers to post a ticket on our kanban board and automatically
                get added to the SBG GitHub organization, replacing an otherwise
                manual process that especially became time consuming during
                times of company acquisitions.

            <p class="body-text">
              Early on in my internship, I set up meetings with engineers from
              other teams and all members of my own team to ask about their
              experience and frustrations with tool migrations. Through these
              conversations, I was able to identify user
              <strong>pain points</strong>.

                  look outdated but also causes confusion. Further, certain

                  notable metaphor or affordance.

            <h2>Design Decisions</h2>
            <p class="body-text">
              Before jumping into implementation, I met with my team to discuss
              the underlying design of the system. A very important decision was
              if the automation was going to be built with an API gateway or a
              Flask web app, so we weighed the most relevant pros and cons.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text space-bottom">
              With the final sketch, I decided to start by presenting not just
              their pastries but the store itself and its history. Then, I
              focused on making sure there were clear divisions between
              information. Sketching out the full interface gave me a thorough
              mental model of what I wanted to accomplish with the low-fidelity
              wireframes.

              alt="Technical architecture diagram"
            />
            <p class="body-text space-bottom">
              This diagram shows the flow of information through my application.
              The workflow starts by a user posting a ticket to our Jira board,
              specifying a task ‚Äúcode‚Äù in the title, and giving the Cisco ID of
              the user that needed to be added in the description. Upon the
              creation of a ticket, a webhook would send the ticket data in the
              form of a JSON to my application, which would then need to be
              parsed to trigger calls to certain endpoints and, in turn,
              interface with the Jira, GitHib, and Cisco MyID REST APIs. A
              result wouldis then be returned back to the user on the original
              Jira ticket, stating whether they were successfully onboarded onto
              GitHub or not.
            </p>

            <p class="body-text">WRITE</p>
            <h2 class="space-bottom">Testing</h2>
            <p class="body-text">
              Throughout the development process, I wrote units in pytest to
              ensure that the endpoints of each function were working as
              expected leveraging mocked ticket data. Thorough testing was
              especially important for this project as it was necessary to parse
              commands from Jira tickets which might not properly follow the
              code schema I created. In both success cases and a variety of
              error cases, such as incorrectly formatted tickets and system
              errors, it was necessary to send different communications back to
              the user.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text space-bottom">
              I also used Postman to intercept and send test API requests to my
              application to make sure that the success and error responses were
              returning as expected. This was especially useful as the
              automation platform interacted with multiple APIs, and I could
              ensure that the platform was sending the proper requests to such
              interfaces.
            </p>
            <h2 class="space-bottom">Documentation & Presentation</h2>
            <p class="body-text">
              Externally for users of the automation platform, I created
              documentation that specifies how to format and submit a ticket to
              my team‚Äôs kanban board that would kick off the automation
              workflow. Internally for my team, I produced a design doc that
              contained a high level overview of my project, technical
              implementation details, and next steps to continue scaling it up
              to an automation platform that could perform the creation of new
              repositories, Jira projects, and AD/Okta groups.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
              I also got to present the automation platform, to
