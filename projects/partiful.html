                a venture-backed, social event planning platform that targets
                Gen Z and Millennial users. Compared to competitors like
                Eventbrite and Facebook, Partiful is highly customizable with
                trendy graphics and themes, enabling users to truly capture the
                vibe of their event and delight their guests. To scale after
                their series-A, the startup is hoping to increase user traction
                and engagement, and we are aiming to deliver customization
                features that do just that.

                Since Partiful has an established platform and design system,
                our aim was not a complete redesign. Instead, our goal was to
                introduce new features on top of the existing interface and
                functionality that would enhance the user experience of event
                page customization. Further, I mainly took ownership over the
                title font customization and ‚ÄúPartiful your Guests‚Äù cover image
                features.

              As we are all users of Partiful‚Äôs product, we excitedly explored
              the existing event customization page, putting ourselves in the
              shoes of a Partiful employee to prioritize feasibility and a user
              to enable out-of-the-box thinking. We kicked off the ideation
              process by having a conversation about any thoughts each of us had
              to further customization. This multi-hour meeting led to a laundry
              list of ideas.

            <h2>Sketching</h2>
            <p class="body-text">
              We began to bring our ideas to life through roughly sketching
              features that would require meaningful adjustments to the existing
              interface: title font customization, animated or interactive cover
              images, music integration, and theme generation. Each member did
              their own sketches, which allowed us to explore different avenues
              of implementation.

              />
            </div>
            <p class="body-text space-bottom">
              When evaluating sketches, we decided to narrow the scope and
              ultimately forward went with title font customization, music
              integration, and theme generation through AI and color selection.
              We decided to cut animated or interactive cover images since these
              images are already customizable and, therefore, assumed this idea
              would be less of a priority from a business perspective.

            <p class="body-text">
              Wireframing allowed us to put these feature implementations and
              test their cohesion on the interface, which was especially
              important given the emphasis Partiful puts on WYSIWYG in their
              design philosophy.

            <h4>‚û°Ô∏è Remember to weigh technical feasibility</h4>
            <p class="body-text">
              Lots of the feedback we got during our final demo to the Partiful
              team was questioning technical feasibility and also usability. In
              particular, we did not fully think through how the hue overlay
              would be built. Wearing different hats as a designer, especially
              before creating high-fidelity mockups, is incredibly important,
              because if an idea is not technically feasible it will not enter
              development.
            </p>
            <h4>‚û°Ô∏è Feedback is a gift</h4>
            <p class="body-text">
              The most valuable part of the iterative design process was
              receiving really specific, thoughtful feedback from our points of
              contact. We saw how important good feedback is as it illuminated
              crucial blind spots for us to consider that enabled us to refine
              and ultimately design a better interface. Although we know that
              Partiful is more focused on building out the robustness of user
              networking on the platform right now, we hope that some of our
              ideas are implemented at some point. Regardless, I want to give
              Partiful a huge shoutout for giving us this wonderful opportunity
              to work with them on this project!
