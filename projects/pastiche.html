            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p class="proj-body">
              Although Pastiche truly sells impeccable pastries, their website
              is difficult to navigate and learn, has accessibility issues, is
              not responsive, and fails to embody the coziness and European
              essense of this Federal Hill staple.
            </p>
            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p class="proj-body">
              The objective of this redesign is to make Pastiche's corner of the
              internet embody the experience of walking into their shop‚Äîthe
              smell of butter and sugar wafting from freshly baked pastries and
              the intricate painted murals of rolling green hills‚Äîto invite new
              and loyal customers alike inside. Secondly, this redesign will focus on redesigning outdated components to ensure that this 40-year old bakery
              is able stay relevant in our increasingly digital world.
            </p>
            <h2>Scope</h2>
            <p class="proj-body">
              This project exclusively focuses on redesigning the homepage of
              Pastiche's website, which is why some clickable links are just
              simulated.

              <li>
                The <strong>navbar text is difficult to read</strong> when

              </li>
              <li>
                The interface is <strong>not responsive</strong>, resulting in bizzare cropping of photos and
                loss of information, specifically customer favorites
              </li>
              <li>
                Important information, such as hours and ordering, is <strong>cluttered in the center</strong> of the

                There are <strong>unclear distinctions between descriptions</strong>, such as the "About"
                and "The Shop" options in the navbar, that require relearning
              </li>
              <li>
                The <strong>footer has missing content</strong>, such as the "A happy customer" column, that cause
                confusion and distraction
              </li>
              <li>
                The photo of the cappuccino and cakes in the customer favorites
                carousel
                <strong> do not clearly convey that they are buttons</strong>,
                lacking notable metaphor or affordance, and only triggers a
                cursor change and slight transparent image overlay causing misclicks
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>üåé Accessibility</h2>
            <ul class="body-text">
              <li>
                There is a significant <strong>lack in contrast</strong> between
                the light gray text and white background at the center of the
                interface; this lack of contrast is also apparent with the
                lighter blue text and blue background in the footer

                The

            </div>
            <p class="proj-body">
              The starting, 9-box sketch was an opportunity to put
              pen to paper on any interface designs that came to mind for Pastiche!
              After reflecting on my initial, rough ideas, I gravitated towards
              a very minimalistic landing page that embodied the European-style
              of Pastiche and invited users to enter the website like you would the bakery itself.
            </p>
            <p class="proj-body space-bottom">
              With the final sketch, I decided to start by presenting
              photos of not just the desserts Pastiche sells but the store
              itself and its history. Then, I focused on making sure
              there were clear divisions between information. Sketching out the full interface gave me a thorough mental model of what I wanted to
              accomplish in the low-fidelity wireframes.
            </p>
            <h2 class="space-bottom">Low-fidelity Wireframes</h2>

            <p class="proj-body space-bottom">
              The low-fidelity wireframes were
              essential in the process of refining the design to make sure I was
              addressing user pain points identified during research and
              planning out responsiveness across desktop and mobile interfaces.
              Then, I was able to move onto making all of my ideas come to life
              in the high-fidelity wireframes, accompanied by the style guide.

              The high-fidelity prototypes fully implement the general layout of
              the low-fidelity wireframes, all the components and attributes in the style
              guide, and aims to embody the spirit of Pastiche, Providence's
              historic, European-style bakery shop. Certain components of the
              interface were designed intentionally to accomplish my objective:
              <ul class="body-text">
                <li><strong>Title fonts:</strong> Sticking with the original "Pastiche" logo font allows consistentcy throughout the interface and gives a established feel </li>
                <li><strong>Font color and size:</strong> The deep navy blue and cream create strong contrast for readibility and font size is scaled dynamically depending on the interface dimensions </li>
                <li><strong>About section image carousel and description: </strong> The description alongside images of Pastiche's storefront, bakers, and interior immediately give the users an understanding of the bakery and what it has to offer</li>
                <li><strong>Favorites section and order button: The floating nature of the cakes allow users to easily view customer favorites and the constrasting, centered order button gives an easy solution for users to satisfy their sweet tooth</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Complete, scaled footer:</strong> The completeness and organization of the footer decreases user confusion and presents information that is easy to understand and interact with </li>

            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p class="proj-body">
              I found this project to be quite challenging
              given that it was my first time using Bootstrap and media queries!
              At the same time, the process of redesigning an interface was
              really rewarding. More specifically, I really enjoyed the process
              of researching and designing a digital interface from scratch and developing it into
              a relatively functional and responsive final website. I found
              it especially satisfying because I am often annoyed how I
              can never provide direct feedback when interfaces frustrate me. I
              loved how I could take it into my own hands with this project, and
              I also learned really useful UX principles from sketching to coding the final product.
