              Through <strong>user interviews</strong>, I discovered issues with
              navigating Pastiche‚Äôs website that mainly fell in the realms of
              usability, learnability/memorability, and accessibility.

                <p class="body-text p-0">
                  The footer has missing content, which not only makes the site
                  look outdated but also causes confusion. Further, certain
                  photos do not clearly convey that they are buttons, lacking
                  notable metaphor or affordance.
                </p>

                <p class="body-text p-0">
                  The navbar text is difficult to read when images with darker
                  hues underlay it. The light gray text against the white
                  background is not readable; the same lack of contrast applies
                  to the footer.

              The 9-box speed sketch was an opportunity to put pen to paper on
              any interface designs that came to mind for Pastiche. I ended up
              gravitating towards a very minimalistic landing page that embodied
              the European-style of Pastiche and invited users to enter the
              website like you would the bakery itself.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text space-bottom">
              With the final sketch, I decided to start by presenting not just
              their pastries but the store itself and its history. Then, I
              focused on making sure there were clear divisions between
              information. Sketching out the full interface gave me a thorough
              mental model of what I wanted to accomplish with the low-fidelity
              wireframes.

              These wireframes were essential in the process of refining the

                  To declutter the landing page, I opted for a minimized navbar
                  that could be maximized through clicking a hamburger icon.
                  Further, the clickability through ‚ÄúFavorites‚Äù are denoted by
                  arrow icons. Using icons allows the interface to efficiently
                  convey functionality to the user through metaphorical
                  affordance.

                <p class="body-text space-top">
                  During development, I focused on ensuring that each component
                  is responsive to the smallest mobile device to the largest
                  desktop. This technical functionality has important
                  implications for accessibility and, ultimately, Pastiche‚Äôs
                  brand credibility.

              the low-fidelity wireframes, all the components and attributes in
              the style guide, and aims to embody the spirit of Pastiche,
              Providence's historic, European-style bakery shop. Certain

                and gives an established feel.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Font color and size:</strong> The deep navy blue and
                cream create strong contrast for readability, and font size is
                scaled dynamically depending on the interface dimensions.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>About section image carousel and description:</strong>
                The description alongside images of Pastiche's storefront,
                bakers, and interior immediately give users an understanding of
                the bakery and what it has to offer.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Favorites section and order button:</strong> The
                floating nature of the cakes allows users to easily view
                customer favorites, and the contrasting, centered order button
                gives an easy solution for users to satisfy their sweet tooth.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Complete, scaled footer:</strong> The completeness and
                organization of the footer decreases user confusion and presents
                information that is easy to understand and interact with.

            <h4>‚û°Ô∏è The importance responsiveness</h4>
            <p class="body-text">
              Through learning by doing, I saw the simultaneous challenge and
              importance of interface responsiveness. Responsiveness demands
              creative thinking that balances conveying a component in the same
              way but with less space, which increases design and development
              time. In the specific use case of Pastiche, the ability to view
              the website on mobile devices is incredibly important for
              discoverability, since the chance that users are on their phones
              searching for pastry places is high. The lack of responsiveness of
              Pastiche‚Äôs website limits access to information for a subset of
              users and potentially could turn potential customers away,
              impacting Pastiche‚Äôs bottom line.
            </p>
            <h4>‚û°Ô∏è Getting feedback early</h4>
            <p class="body-text">
              Since I was working on this project solo, I felt that deciding
              between ideas became difficult without input from another.
              Therefore, I took the initiative to finish my research and
              low-fidelity wireframes early and go to office hours. Through
              managing the timeline of my redesign well, I was able to get
              pivotal advice that helped improve the end product. I saw
              first-hand how getting feedback early on in the product
              development cycle and making changes then saves resources overall.
